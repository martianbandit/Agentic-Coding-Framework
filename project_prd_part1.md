## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objective of Document
This PRD defines the requirements for the "AI-Driven Digital Micro-Product Factory" (ADMPF). It serves as the primary guide for developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), detailing the vision, key features, technical architecture, user experience, and business objectives.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
Revolutionize the creation and sale of micro-products for solopreneurs and e-commerce creators by automating and simplifying every step from ideation to market launch using intelligent AI and intuitive design. ADMPF will transform how digital creators monetize their knowledge by providing the first truly integrated AI-powered platform that dramatically reduces time-to-market while increasing professional quality.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Solopreneurs and digital creators face significant barriers when trying to:
- Identify and validate profitable niches and product ideas (72% of failed products attributed to poor niche selection)
- Create high-quality digital content efficiently (average creator spends 15-20 hours per product)
- Generate professional product visuals (68% cite design as a major challenge)
- Determine optimal pricing and packaging (82% report difficulty in optimal pricing)
- Quickly launch sales channels with minimal technical knowledge (61% abandonment rate due to technical barriers)
- Provide customer support with limited resources

### 1.4 Solution Overview
ADMPF is a SaaS platform enabling users to enter a product idea or niche, then using AI to:
1. Validate and enhance the idea based on market data
2. Generate complete product content (text, structure, visuals)
3. Create professional visual assets (covers, mockups, promotional materials)
4. Suggest optimal pricing and packaging strategies
5. Automatically generate a sales page and storefront
6. Handle payments, delivery, and basic customer support

The platform's unique value proposition is "From Idea to Income in Minutes" - providing an end-to-end solution where competitors offer only fragmented tools.
